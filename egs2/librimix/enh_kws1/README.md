## Guideline

1. Download LibriSpeech, WHAM!, and Hey-Snips. You need to get scps of these datasets.
2. Use LibriMix on the Github to generate the official Libri2Mix (L2M) dataset.
3. Use the `local/generate_s2m.sh` to generate the S2M, which requires Snips, LibriSpeech as speaker 1 and speaker 2, respectively. We apply only the `min` mode for data generation.
4. Merge L2M and S2M train and dev scps into `dump/raw/{train-snips-min,dev-snips-min}`. Then, copy L2M and S2M test datasets into two folders at `dump/raw`, such as `test-snips-min` and `test-libri2mix-min`. Note that `cond{10,20,50,100}.scp` should be placed under the folder of train scps, which are generated by randomly picking snips utterances.
5. Use the `run.sh` from stage 5 to stage 8 to train and evaluate the frontend model.
6. Use the Snips recipe in WeKws to conduct the KWS evaluation. Test data should be in the format as WeKws requires.
